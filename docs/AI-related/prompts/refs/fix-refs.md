The file `final-document/references/chapters-2-10/prepared-references-2-10.md` file contains all the sorted references from Chatpers 2-10. However, many of them had issues.
I personally went into the trouble of finding which had problems and fixed them.
I created this file `final-document/references/chapters-2-10/required-actions.md` to document what I found and how I fixed them. There are 3 types of actions you should take:

- **Type 1: "Nothing - Its correct as is"**: These references were fine as is. No action needed.
- **Type 2: "Update Reference Only"**: This meamns that you only need to update the reference in the `prepared-references-2-10.md` file. No changes needed in the main thesis file (`final-document/Thesis_Final.md`) in-text citations.
- **Type 3: "Update Reference & In-text Citations"**: This means you need to update both the in-text citation in the main thesis file (`final-document/Thesis_Final.md`) and the reference in the `prepared-references-2-10.md` file.
