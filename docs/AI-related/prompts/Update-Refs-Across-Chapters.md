# Updating References Across Chapters

Sadly, some of the references provided by AI for my thesis are either outdated, incorrect, or completely hallucinated.

Thus, I need your help to update the references across multiple chapters.

I have already done the ground work by identifying which references need to be updated or replaced with new ones. You can find this information in the `final-document/tmp` directory, where I have created multiple markdown files named `references-batch-XX-completed.md`, where `XX` is the index of each batch.

To better navigate the project read this [File System Conventions Overview](../../file-system-conventions/00-overview.md).

## Your Task

1. You will provided which of the batch file (`references-batch-XX-completed.md`) in the `final-document/tmp` you should work on next.
2. As we do not want the references adhering to Markdown format (currently they all do that) but rather the correct APA 7 style (as in the batch files), you will have to update all the references regardless of whether they need to be replaced or not.
3. There 2 types of references that need to be replaced:
   - References marked as "Requires New Ref": You must replace the old reference with the new reference provided in the same batch file.
   - References marked as "Requires Update": You must update the old reference with the updated reference provided in the same batch file.
     Regardless of replacement or update, is **absolutely crucial** that you ensure that the **in-text citations** in the chapters are also updated accordingly to reflect the changes made in the references section.
