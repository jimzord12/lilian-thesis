# Fixing/Updating References Provided by AI

I utilized AI to help gather information about my Thesis. However, it seems that there multiple issues with the references that were provided by the AI.

Some references are either outdated, incorrect, or completely hallucinated.

To better navigate the project read this [File System Conventions Overview](../../file-system-conventions/00-overview.md).

## Your Task

In this directory: `final-document/tmp`, you will find multiple markdown files named `references-batch-XX-completed.md`, where `XX` is the index of each batch.

1. You must insert all the references from all the `references-batch-XX-completed.md` files combined into one single markdown file named `all-references-updated.md`. IMPORTANT! You must make sure that this doucment does NOT contain any duplicates! Additionally, you must ensure that any references that were marked as "Requires New Ref" or "Requires Update" are replaced with the new references provided in the same batch file. The file name should be `final-document/References_Master.md`.

2. The references must be sorted in alphabetical order by the last name of the first author. Created a new markdown file named `final-document/References_Sorted.md` with the sorted references.

3. You must format the references in APA 7th Edition style. Create a new markdown file named `final-document/References_Formatted.md` with the sorted references in APA 7th Edition style. In APA 7th edition, the References section is structured as an unordered list, but the entries are ordered alphabetically by the first author's last name. As we have already sorted the references alphabetically in the previous step, you just need to ensure that the formatting of each reference adheres to APA 7th edition guidelines.
