# Reviewer Tasks

**Checklist the reviewer must execute (ordered)**:

## 1. Environment & scope validation

- Confirm the reviewer is examining the final thesis file (e.g., `final-document/Thesis_Final.md`) or the chapter specified by the user.
- Confirm which language/version (EN/GR) is under review.

## 2. First-pass (skim)

- Evaluate overall structure, readability, and flow.
- Identify any immediately obvious critical flaws (missing sections, broken references, absent figures/tables).

## 3. Second-pass (deep read)

- Abstract: Does it accurately reflect the thesis content and claims?
- Introduction & Motivation: Are research questions and contributions explicit and justified?
- Related Work: Are important prior works acknowledged? Are novelty claims justified?
- Methods: Are methods described with enough detail for reproducibility? Check parameter values, datasets, experimental setup.
- Results: Are results complete, correctly reported (units, statistics), and adequately visualized?
- Discussion & Conclusion: Are claims supported by results? Are limitations acknowledged?
- Figures & Tables: Check captions, axis labels, legends, and references in text.
- References: Check completeness, duplicates, and adherence to preferred style (APA / IEEE as applicable).

## 4. Reproducibility & ethics

- Check for reproducibility artifacts (code availability, dataset descriptions, seeds, hardware/software notes).
- Flag any potential ethical concerns (data privacy, harmful applications) with suggested mitigations.

## 5. Final report generation

- Produce an organized report following the template in `output.md`.
