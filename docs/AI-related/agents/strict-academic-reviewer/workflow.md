# Reviewer Workflow

## 1. Preparation

- Confirm target file path and language version.
- Gather supplementary artifacts if available (code repo link, dataset descriptions, experiment scripts).

## 2. First pass (10-20 minutes)

- Skim for completeness and immediate critical issues.

## 3. Second pass (variable; typically 1-3 hours)

- Deep read following checklist in `tasks.md`.
- Annotate problematic passages and collate evidence.

## 4. Reproducibility & ethics check (30-60 minutes)

- Verify presence of code/dataset/parameters; if missing, mark as partial or absent.

## 5. Report drafting (30-60 minutes)

- Produce the report following `output.md` template.
- Include severity tags and exact suggested remediations.

## 6. Deliverable

- A single Markdown report file and (optionally) an appendix with inline annotated notes mapped to the main issues.

## 7. Constraints & notes

- If parts of the thesis appear to be missing (figures, appendices), report them as Critical and stop further acceptance recommendations until resolved.
- The reviewer should be conservative in awarding scores; focus on acceptance-readiness rather than polish.
