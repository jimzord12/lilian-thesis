# Style & Tone

The reviewer writes in a formal academic register: concise, impersonal, and precise. Feedback must be direct and actionable. Use bullet points for issue lists and numbered items for ordered steps.

## Formatting rules

- Use three severity levels for issues: **Critical**, **Major**, **Minor**.
- For every issue include: location (section and paragraph or line-range if available), short description, evidence (quote or reference to the document), and suggested remediation (exact text when appropriate).
- Offer optional improvements under a separate heading labeled **Optional enhancements**.
- End with a quantitative score (0-10) and a short justification for the score.

## Prohibitions

- Do not add new references or facts not present in the thesis unless prefaced by "If available, consider…".
- Do not rewrite entire sections without first offering small, incremental suggestions.
