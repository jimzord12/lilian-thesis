## 2. Executive summary (100-200 words)

The thesis entitled "Maritime Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Analysis of Communication Networks, Autonomous Systems, and Emerging Technologies" provides a robust, state-of-the-art synthesis of the MIoT landscape. It successfully maps the multi-layered architecture of Maritime 4.0/5.0, covering connectivity (6G/NTN), perception (UWSNs), intelligence (AI/Digital Twins), and trust (Zero Trust/Blockchain). The work is highly current, with extensive citations from 2024–2025. 

However, the document currently fails to meet "Final" submission standards due to several critical flaws: (1) multiple placeholders remain in the front matter (Title Page, ToC, Acknowledgements); (2) the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology is underdeveloped, lacking the rigor required for a forensic-level review (e.g., search strings, PRISMA flow); and (3) significant technical artifacts and encoding errors are present in tables and the bibliography. Acceptance is pending the resolution of these issues and a more detailed methodological exposition.

## 3. Major/Critical issues (ordered by severity)

1. **Severity: Critical**
   - **Location**: Front Matter (Lines 5–185)
   - **Description**: Presence of multiple placeholders for essential document components.
   - **Evidence**: `[Placeholder for Title Page (Greek)]`, `[Placeholder for Title Page (English)]`, `[Placeholder for Acknowledgements]`, `[Placeholder for ToC to be generated by Typst]`.
   - **Suggested remediation**: Replace all placeholders with final content. Generate the Table of Contents, List of Figures, and List of Tables. Complete the Title Page with the author's and supervisor's names.

2. **Severity: Major**
   - **Location**: Section 1.4 (Lines 223–233)
   - **Description**: Methodological transparency is insufficient for a Systematic Literature Review (SLR).
   - **Evidence**: "Η παρούσα εργασία ακολουθεί τη μεθοδολογία της συστηματικής βιβλιογραφικής ανασκόπησης." Followed by a brief list of databases and keywords.
   - **Suggested remediation**: Expand this section to include: (a) specific search strings used for each database; (b) a PRISMA flow diagram or text description of the selection process (number of papers identified, screened, and included); and (c) the quality appraisal criteria used to select the "state-of-the-art" works.

3. **Severity: Major**
   - **Location**: Section 3.2 / Table 3.1 (Lines 669–681)
   - **Description**: Table contains raw technical artifacts/tags from automated tools or scraping.
   - **Evidence**: Tags like `espublisher​`, `arxiv​`, `ceur-ws​`, `ewadirect​`, `wirelesslab​` appear inside table cells.
   - **Suggested remediation**: Remove all non-academic metadata tags from the table. Ensure the information is presented in clean text, using standard citation brackets (e.g., [12] or Author, Year) if necessary.

4. **Severity: Major**
   - **Location**: Bibliography (Lines 1850-2700)
   - **Description**: Character encoding errors in several reference entries.
   - **Evidence**: `Henrâ€≠quez Larrazâ€°bal, 2022`, `VujiA et al. (2020)`, `Vujiƒáiƒá et al. (2020)`.
   - **Suggested remediation**: Correct the character encoding for all non-ASCII names (e.g., Henríquez Larrazábal, Vujičić). Use UTF-8 consistently to avoid corruption of diacritics.

5. **Severity: Major**
   - **Location**: Section 6.1 (Lines 1344-1350)
   - **Description**: Repetitive introductory boilerplate across multiple sections.
   - **Evidence**: Multiple sections start with nearly identical phrases like "Η ναυτιλιακή βιομηχανία βιώνει έναν σημαντικό ψηφιακό μετασχηματισμό..." or "Το Θαλάσσιο Διαδίκτυο των Πραγμάτων είναι η σύνδεση...".
   - **Suggested remediation**: Rewrite section introductions to be more specific to the subsection's topic. Avoid repeating the general "Maritime industry transformation" context which was already established in Chapter 1.

## 4. Minor issues (stylistic, small corrections)

1. **Location**: Section 3.2 (Line 660) - "1.500 μέτρα ανά δευτερόλεπτο". Fix formatting of numbers (consistent use of decimal/thousands separators).
2. **Location**: Section 10.2 (Line 2300) - Consistency check: "QKD" is used both in English and Greek (ΚΒΚ). Prefer one or consistently use both.
3. **Location**: Throughout - Ensure all Figures (e.g., Figure 2.1 vs 2.2 mismatch in Section 2.2) follow a sequential numbering relative to the chapter (e.g., Figure 2.1, 2.2, 3.1).

## 5. Optional enhancements

- **Cross-referencing**: Increase use of internal hyperlinks (e.g., "discussed in [Section 7.3]") to improve the navigation of the digital document.
- **Visual Synthesis**: Add a "Global MIoT Architecture" diagram in Chapter 11 that synthesizes all levels (Pipes, Things, Brain, Guardrails).
- **Practical Examples**: In Chapter 6, consider adding a specific comparison table of existing AI platforms (BigDataOcean vs. Iliad vs. Sedna).

## 6. Reproducibility checklist

- Data availability: yes / no / partial (Appendix A lists datasets, but they are third-party).
- Code availability: no (Review-based thesis).
- Experimental parameters documented: partial (Parameters for UWSN and 6G are cited from literature).

## 7. Ethical & Safety considerations

The thesis correctly identifies Cybersecurity (Chapter 7) and Sustainability (Chapter 8) as ethical pillars. No additional concerns.

## 8. Overall rating (0-10)

**Score: 6.5/10**

*Justification*: The content is intellectually dense and very well-sourced. It reflects a deep understanding of the domain. However, the presence of placeholders, citation artifacts, and encoding errors gives the impression of an unfinished draft. The methodology lacks the formal rigor expected for a systematic review at the Master's/PhD level.

## 9. Estimated time to remediate

**3-5 days**. Most time should be spent on refining the Methodology (Section 1.4) and cleaning the Bibliography/Tables.

## 10. Suggested next action for the author

**Revise and resubmit after addressing all Major issues.** Pay special attention to the SLR methodology and the cleaning of citation artifacts in Chapter 3.
