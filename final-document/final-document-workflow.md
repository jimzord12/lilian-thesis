# Final Document Assembly Workflow

This document outlines the systematic process for assembling the final thesis from individual chapter drafts.

## **Phase 1: Preparation**
- [x] Verify existence and final state of all completed chapters (Chapters 2-10).
- [x] Ensure all assets (images, tables) are available in `final-document/assets/`.
- [ ] Review `Abbreviations.md` for completeness based on chapters.

## **Phase 2: Main Body Assembly**
- [x] Consolidate Chapter 2: Maritime Communication Networks.
- [x] Consolidate Chapter 3: Underwater and Surface Sensing Systems.
- [x] Consolidate Chapter 4: Maritime Cybersecurity Framework.
- [x] Consolidate Chapter 5: Autonomous Maritime Systems.
- [ ] Consolidate Chapter 6: Digital Twin and Simulation Technologies.
- [ ] Consolidate Chapter 7: Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.
- [ ] Consolidate Chapter 8: Sustainability and Green Maritime IoT.
- [ ] Consolidate Chapter 9: Standardization and Interoperability.
- [ ] Consolidate Chapter 10: Emerging Technologies and Future Directions.

## **Phase 3: Bookending**
- [ ] Finalize Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview (Deferred until main body is stable).
- [ ] Finalize Chapter 11: Conclusions and Future Research Directions (Deferred until main body is stable).

## **Phase 4: Front & Back Matter**
- [ ] Title Page.
- [ ] Abstract (250–350 words).
- [ ] Acknowledgements.
- [ ] Table of Contents (Generated from final structure).
- [ ] List of Figures & Tables.
- [ ] Bibliography (Master References).

## **Phase 5: Polishing & Validation**
- [ ] Cross-chapter reference check.
- [ ] Consistent formatting and style review.
- [ ] Final proofreading.
- [ ] Technical validation of citations and figures.

**Note:** Chapters 1 and 11 are intentionally deferred to Phase 3 to ensure they accurately reflect the finalized content of the technical chapters (2-10).
