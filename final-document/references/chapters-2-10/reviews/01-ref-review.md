# Reference Review Report: Chapters 2-10

**Date:** December 27, 2025
**Scope:** `final-document/references/chapters-2-10/prepared-references-2-10.md`

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The compiled reference list for Chapters 2-10 contains a robust set of academic and industry sources. However, several critical issues were identified during the review, including exact duplicates, near-duplicate entries (e.g., arXiv vs. published versions), and significant formatting inconsistencies. These must be addressed to ensure a professional, submission-ready bibliography.

## 2. Identified Duplicates & Redundancies

### Exact Duplicates
The following entries are identical and should be merged:
- **Shang, Z., Wang, J., & Yang, Y. (2025).** *Maritime communication networks: A survey on architecture, key technologies, and challenges.* (Appears twice).

### Near-Duplicates (Redundant Entries)
These entries refer to the same work but were captured with slightly different metadata:
- **Xylouris, G., et al. (2024):** 
    - Entry 1: "Sailing into the future: Technologies, challenges..."
    - Entry 2: "Technologies, challenges..."
    - *Action:* Keep the version with the full title "Sailing into the future...".
- **Quigley, W. C., et al. (2025):**
    - Listed once as a "Version 1" and once as an "arXiv preprint".
    - *Action:* Consolidate into a single standard arXiv citation format.
- **Farah, M. B., et al. (2024):**
    - Two entries for "A survey on blockchain technology in the maritime industry" with different co-authors and different volume/page numbers (Vol 157 vs Vol 159). 
    - *Action:* Verify if these are two parts of a series or if one is a corrected version. Usually, this indicates a compilation error.

## 3. Formatting Inconsistencies

### Italics and Styles
- **Journal/Book Titles:** Most use standard markdown italics (e.g., *Journal Name*), but many use underscores (e.g., _Journal Name_). These should be standardized.
- **Title Case:** Some titles are in Sentence case (APA standard), while others use Title Case.
    - *Example:* "A Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator..." (Title Case) vs. "Towards automatic anomaly detection..." (Sentence case).

### DOI and URL Formatting
- **Standardization needed:** Some DOIs are wrapped in brackets `[https://doi.org/...]` while others are bare links. 
- **Redirects:** Ensure all DOI links are in the modern format: `https://doi.org/XX.XXXX/XXXX`.

### Date Formats
- Inconsistency between year-only `(2024)` and full dates `(2024, September 7)`. For journal articles, only the year is typically required in APA, whereas for blog posts or news, the full date is appropriate.

## 4. Incomplete/Non-Standard Entries

### Missing Authors
- **"Application of Machine Learning Techniques to the Maritime Industry"** (2023) - Listed by title first.
- **"Machine learning in the maritime industry"** (2025) - Rootstack Insights.
- **"Maritime industry accelerates shift toward digital trade"** (2025) - Offshore Energy.
- *Action:* Search for authors or use the organization as the author (e.g., Semantic Scholar, Rootstack).

### Non-APA Styles
- **Roshier, Gemma.** - Uses a style similar to Chicago/MLA ("Embracing IoT...") rather than APA.
- **“Maritime Connectivity: Essential for the Future of Shipping.”** - Starts with title instead of author/organization.

### Usage of "et al." in Reference List
- **Agostinho, C., et al. (2016).** - "et al." should generally not be used in the final reference list for APA (list up to 20 authors).

## 5. Specific Errors to Fix
- **Ava Singh, (2025...):** Remove the trailing comma after the author name.
- **Lazzarin, J., et al. (2024):** Refers to "Oceans 2023 Proceedings". Verify if the publication year is 2023 or 2024.
- **Sustainability (Savva, C., 2025):** Check volume/issue numbering (Vol 17 for 2025 is correct, but ensure issue 18 is already released or if it's "Advance online publication").

## 6. Recommendations
1. **Run a Deduplication Pass:** Remove the specific duplicates identified in Section 2.
2. **Standardize on APA 7th Edition:** Convert all entries to a uniform Sentence-case for titles and ensure consistent italicization.
3. **Verify Links:** Check that all URLs (especially those for "Advance online publication") are still active.
4. **Author Recovery:** Attempt to find specific authors for the reports and news articles currently listed by title.
