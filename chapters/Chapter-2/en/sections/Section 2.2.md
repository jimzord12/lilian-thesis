## **Section 2.2: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) and 5G/6G Integration in Maritime Communication**

### Why This Matters

Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), such as Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are changing maritime communication. Their combination with 5G and 6G technologies helps deliver reliable coverage for remote maritime operations. This reliability is important for maritime IoT applications, including autonomous shipping, smart ports, and safety at sea (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024).

### Literature Review and Background

Traditional maritime communication depended mainly on geostationary satellites. These offer large coverage but have slow response times and limited data capacity. Recent developments in NTNs, such as LEO satellites and aerial platforms, provide faster service and suit the needs of modern vessels and data-heavy operations. Reviews explain how new networks combine edge processing and distributed systems to improve IoT connectivity and real-time data needs in marine environments (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Deploying NTNs in maritime settings has obstacles such as unpredictable weather, signal loss over long distances, changing radio signals, and limited battery life for UAVs and mobile platforms. Combining NTN with 5G or 6G systems also makes it difficult to control interference between satellites and shore connections, manage signal switches for moving ships, and plan UAV routes for better coverage and lower energy use. Ensuring systems work together across land, air, and sea is another challenge (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024; Pilvik et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Modern maritime networks use services like Starlink and OneWeb’s LEO satellites for safer, faster data connections. UAVs help by extending coverage where satellites or shore connections cannot reach, especially in busy ports. The newest 5G and 6G standards bring tailored features for ships, such as network slicing and large-scale IoT support. Recent research shows that combining land-based wireless mesh networks with NTN connections produces reliable, flexible, and cost-effective communication for ships and offshore rigs (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024; Pilvik et al., 2024).

### Applications and Use Cases

The integration of NTN with 5G/6G is key for several maritime innovations. Smart ports use connected IoT devices to manage cargo and monitor water conditions. LEO satellite services support remote repairs, autonomous navigation, and medical help at sea. UAV relay networks keep ships connected in areas where regular signals are blocked. These combined technologies let ships and ports run continuous video surveillance, emergency responses, fleet management, and equipment monitoring (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024; MOL, 2023).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Future research directions include better sharing of radio space between land-based and non-terrestrial networks, using artificial intelligence for data flow management, and improving handover methods for fast-moving ships. The next generation 6G systems will likely use machine learning for smart coordination between satellites, UAVs, and ship-based sensors. Setting international standards and designing networks that use less power are important tasks for the future (Jung et al., 2023; Xylouris et al., 2024).
