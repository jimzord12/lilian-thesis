## **2.4 Maritime Cognitive Radio Networks**

### Why This Matters

Managing radio spectrum efficiently is very important for modern maritime communication networks. With more ships, sensors, and devices using wireless connections at sea, traditional static spectrum allocation often leads to congestion, slower communication, and unreliable operations. Cognitive radio networks offer intelligent ways to use available spectrum more flexibly and safely, which supports safer navigation, ship coordination, and better data transfer across maritime IoT systems (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

### Literature Review and Background

Cognitive radio technology allows devices to detect unused radio frequencies and use them without disturbing licensed users. Early research tried to adapt these techniques from land-based networks to ships and offshore platforms at sea. The main goal was to cope with limited spectrum, variable sea conditions, and the mobility of vessels. Newer studies suggest using cooperative spectrum sensing and centralized management to make detection more reliable, even when ships move, and radio signals change due to sea waves and weather (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

There are several challenges when using cognitive radio networks at sea. The moving water surface affects radio signals, leading to unstable connections and errors in detecting free channels. Satellite links also create high latency, and ships have limited power for running complex communication tasks. In the open sea, there are no fixed infrastructures, so mobile platforms must share spectrum information while moving. Regulations require that cognitive radios do not interfere with safety-critical systems like those used for emergency communications. This makes design and operation even more complex (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Today, maritime cognitive radio networks use spectrum sensing methods such as energy detection to recognize available channels. Cooperative sensing, where ships share their findings with a main control center or each other, is common and helps make decisions more accurate. Software-defined networking is often combined with cognitive radio, allowing centralized yet flexible control over which frequencies ships and other users use. These systems adapt to changing needs and improve data transfer even in rough conditions (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

### Applications and Use Cases

Examples of these networks in action include sharing data between ships, real-time environmental monitoring, and supporting autonomous vessels. Some ports and research missions use cognitive radio combined with centralized management to handle many types of devices and operations. These systems have been shown to increase data throughput, reduce interference, and improve the overall reliability of maritime communications (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Future research is focused on making spectrum sensing more robust against changing sea states, using artificial intelligence to manage spectrum use and energy consumption, and integrating new wireless technologies like 6G. Distributed network architectures that allow ships and autonomous vehicles to make local decisions could improve reliability. There is also a need for better international cooperation and standards to ensure these systems work together safely around the world (Ghafoor & Koo, 2020; Zheng et al., 2023).
