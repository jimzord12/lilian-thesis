## **Section 2.6: Maritime Edge and Fog Computing**

### Why This Matters

Bringing computational power closer to ships and sensors is increasingly critical for Maritime Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In remote or bandwidth-constrained ocean environments, edge and fog computing play a vital role by enabling real-time analytics, lowering latency, and improving energy efficiency directly onboard vessels and platforms. These distributed computing paradigms are essential for the expansion of smart shipping, dynamic port operations, and automated maritime safety solutions (Danelec, 2025; Sanikommu et al., 2025).

### Literature Review and Background

Edge computing in maritime contexts refers to processing data directly at or near its source, such as onboard ships or local maritime infrastructure, while fog computing extends this by interconnecting multiple local devices for distributed processing and intermediate data storage. Early research highlighted the use of edge artificial intelligence and sensor fusion onboard vessels to manage telemetry, optimize engine performance, and support rapid decision-making in dynamic sea conditions (Danelec, 2025). Recent developments have demonstrated real-time ship and port detection using advanced deep learning models on edge devices, enhancing surveillance and environmental monitoring capabilities for the sector (Sanikommu et al., 2025).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

The maritime environment imposes several unique challenges on edge and fog computing. Ships experience lasting connectivity gaps, fluctuating network conditions, and strict resource constraints on energy and hardware. Traditional cloud-centric processing is infeasible due to high latency and unreliable links at sea. Edge devices require solutions for interoperability across varied hardware, robust data synchronization, and protection against cyber and physical threats (Sanikommu et al., 2025). Fog architectures must cope with mobility, dynamic topologies, and regulatory constraints while ensuring data gravity and privacy, especially for sensitive operational or environmental information (Xylouris et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Contemporary maritime networks adopt distributed computing architectures, blending edge nodes onboard vessels with fog servers at port facilities or within fleets. Hierarchical cloud-fog-edge models support efficient, low-latency artificial intelligence-powered analytics for operations such as collision detection, vessel monitoring, and emissions control (Danelec, 2025; Ghoshal et al., 2024; Farooq et al., 2022). Resource management, offloading strategies, and federated learning allow multiple vessels and unmanned systems to share models securely without centralizing data, helping reduce transmission needs and latency while improving compliance and energy optimization at sea (Sanikommu et al., 2025; Xylouris et al., 2024).

### Applications and Use Cases

Maritime edge and fog computing systems are applied in real-time vessel performance monitoring, ship recognition from remote imagery, environmental pollution detection, and operational safety (Danelec, 2025; Sanikommu et al., 2025). Onboard edge devices process sensor data on fuel use, hull stress, and navigation cues locally, enabling timely insights for ship crews and shore-based teams. Advanced ship and port detection systems using deep learning models demonstrate high accuracy and scalability, supporting robust maritime surveillance even in resource-constrained environments (Sanikommu et al., 2025). Underwater fog computing now enables cost-effective data science and improved resilience for ocean sensors (Farooq et al., 2022).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Next-wave research focuses on improving distributed maritime computing frameworks to support extreme mobility, federated learning, and energy-constrained IoT devices in challenging ocean settings (Xylouris et al., 2024; Ghoshal et al., 2024). Promising areas include enhancing multi-region fog architectures for global ocean coverage, integrating edge artificial intelligence into autonomous ships, and supporting real-time analytics for climate and regulatory compliance. Key open challenges involve achieving robust security, seamless data interoperability, and scalable artificial intelligence-driven resource allocation under real-world maritime operational conditions (Sanikommu et al., 2025; Farooq et al., 2022).
