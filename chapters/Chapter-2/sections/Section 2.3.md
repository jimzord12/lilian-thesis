## **Section 2.3 Heterogeneous Communication Networks**

### Why This Matters

Heterogeneous communication networks are important for maritime IoT because they help ships, ports, and marine systems stay connected using different communication technologies. Reliable connections support daily operations, safety, and help gather data from both people and machines. Blending different networks, such as satellite, radio, and cellular, makes shipping smarter and helps ports automate work, which is key for the digital transformation of ocean industries (Xylouris et al., 2024; Hoeft et al., 2022).

### Literature Review and Background

Maritime communication has changed from separate radio and satellite systems to combined networks using space, air, and land resources. Recent studies show hybrid networks can connect ships far from shore and keep data flowing in harsh environments. Machine learning methods, like deep learning for choosing the best wireless link, have helped ships switch connections smoothly and use less energy. Maritime IoT platforms now try to make sure different sensors and devices can work together easily (Wei et al., 2021; Hoeft et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2024).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Connecting many types of networks at sea is difficult. Wireless signals can become weak or get mixed up by water and weather. Satellite systems cover a wide area but can be slow and cost a lot; land-based networks are faster but only work close to shore. When ships move from one type of network to another, they need strong systems to keep the connection working. Network differences make it hard for devices to share data, as not all use the same standards or have enough battery power. It is also hard to manage which messages should be sent first and to keep everything secure, so smart ways to share network resources and translate data are needed (Xylouris et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2024; Hoeft et al., 2022).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Today, maritime communication networks mix satellite, cellular (like 4G/5G), Wi-Fi, and radio. Smart systems use artificial intelligence to pick the best connection and share traffic between different networks. Simple methods help save energy and make data sharing more reliable for many devices. The netBaltic system uses ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore wireless connections without satellites, helping more ships stay connected. Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and underwater robots use IoT platforms to share sensor data, locations, and instructions with each other quickly (Hoeft et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2024; Woźniak et al., 2018).

### Applications and Use Cases

Mixed networks are used to make shipping safer and operations more efficient. In smart ports and supply chains, they help track ships in real time and manage cargo. Robot boats and remote devices use radio and satellite to share their location and avoid collisions. Automatic systems use collected data to predict ship movements and improve safety along busy routes. Using networks that link many ships together helps spread information over longer distances and lets fleets work together better (Kang et al., 2024; Hoeft et al., 2022; Woźniak et al., 2018).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

New research is looking at combining 6G networks, artificial intelligence, and ways for devices to learn together to make connections better and safer. Important problems still need solutions, such as switching smoothly between satellite, radio, and land networks, saving energy, and stopping interference in crowded waters. There is a need for common standards and for systems that can easily connect all types of ships and sensors. To connect remote and rough ocean areas reliably, networks will need smarter control systems, stronger equipment, and better ways for devices to cooperate (Xylouris et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2021).
