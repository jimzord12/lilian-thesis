## Generation Prompt

**Type:** Conceptual Infographic / Diagram

**Style:** Modern, illustrative, easy to understand. Using boat icons/silhouettes instead of generic triangles/boids.

**Components to Include:**

- Three distinct panels or sections, each illustrating one rule:
  1.  **Separation (Collision Avoidance):** Show a central boat steering _away_ from crowding neighbors to maintain a safe distance. Use small arrows to show repulsive force.
  2.  **Alignment (Velocity Matching):** Show a central boat adjusting its heading/speed to _match_ the average direction of its neighbors. Use parallel arrows to show shared direction.
  3.  **Cohesion (Flock Centering):** Show a central boat steering _towards_ the average position (center of mass) of the local group. Use inward arrows towards a center point.

**Visual Flow:**

- Horizontal layout (Panel 1 | Panel 2 | Panel 3).
- Each panel should clearly label the rule (Separation, Alignment, Cohesion).
- Use a "Hero" boat (e.g., blue) interacting with "Neighbor" boats (e.g., gray).

**Color Scheme:**

- **Boats:** Blue (Self) and Gray (Neighbors).
- **Force Vectors/Arrows:**
  - _Separation:_ Red (danger/avoid).
  - _Alignment:_ Green (safe/flow).
  - _Cohesion:_ Orange or Purple (grouping).
- **Water:** Light blue background.

**Additional Notes:** The text references "Russell & Norvig, 2021" for these rules. Ensure the visualization clearly distinguishes between the _direction_ (Alignment) and the _position_ (Cohesion) adjustments.
