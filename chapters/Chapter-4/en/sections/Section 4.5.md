## **Section 4.5: Blockchain Applications in Maritime Supply Chains**

### Why This Matters

Maritime supply chains are vital for global trade, carrying more than 90% of the world’s cargo by volume (Liu et al., 2023). However, the sector faces challenges including fragmented documentation processes, lack of transparency, and weak trust between stakeholders (Farah et al., 2024). Blockchain technology presents solutions to these problems through permanent records, smart contract automation, and transparent, shared data. As the industry embraces digital transformation, blockchain is a foundational component for efficiency, reliability, and sustainability (Farah et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023).

### Literature Review and Background

There is a growing body of literature on blockchain applications in maritime logistics. Surveys and systematic reviews describe how blockchain solutions are being piloted and evaluated for secure document sharing, traceability of cargo, and coordination among ports, shippers, and regulators (Farah et al., 2024). Well-known pilot projects include IBM/Maersk’s TradeLens, CargoSmart’s Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), and Abu Dhabi Ports' Silsal platform, all demonstrating the feasibility of blockchain for end-to-end digital documentation and secure data exchange in maritime trade (Irannezhad, 2020; Abu Dhabi Ports, 2018).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Widespread blockchain adoption in maritime supply chains faces significant hurdles. Technical challenges involve integration with existing legacy port systems, scalability for large transaction volumes, and the need for robust cybersecurity (Surucu-Balci et al., 2024). Organizational resistance to change, high implementation costs, inconsistent data standards, and complex regulatory environments further complicate adoption (Maritime industry accelerates..., 2025). Fragmented global supply chains mean that aligning all participants on interoperable blockchain platforms is complex, although organizations such as DCSA (Digital Container Shipping Association) and BIMCO have begun standardization efforts (Farah et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Most blockchain implementations in maritime supply chains focus on three areas: digital documentation (such as electronic bills of lading and certificates of origin), automation of business processes using smart contracts, and enhanced traceability and coordination across the logistics chain (Liu et al., 2023). Platforms like TradeLens deliver secure document flows and real-time cargo visibility, while Silsal at Abu Dhabi Ports enables secure document and identity management across supply chain actors (Irannezhad, 2020). Collaboration through the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) highlights industry efforts to create widely accepted digital shipping platforms, with early pilots showing significant reductions in paperwork and transaction times (Abu Dhabi Ports, 2018; Farah et al., 2024).

### Applications and Use Cases

Notable real-world applications include secure and efficient tracking of containers through immutable records, automation of customs processes, digital management of bills of lading, and real-time monitoring for refrigerated (reefer) containers (Farah et al., 2024). The TradeLens system, for instance, has enabled over 100 organizations to track shipments, automate customs approvals, and reduce disputes (Liu et al., 2023). At Abu Dhabi Ports, the Silsal blockchain service links users through digital identities, encrypting sensitive documents and streamlining the movement of goods (Abu Dhabi Ports, 2018). These pilots highlight blockchain’s capacity to increase speed, reliability, and security across the maritime logistics chain (Irannezhad, 2020).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Key gaps remain in blockchain standardization, system interoperability, and rigorous assessment of cost-benefit trade-offs for full-scale deployments (Surucu-Balci et al., 2024). Research is needed to harmonize international data standards (such as those by DCSA and BIMCO), support privacy-preserving blockchain mechanisms, and provide empirical studies of full supply-chain implementations (Farah et al., 2024). Integrating blockchain with IoT and artificial intelligence could further increase resilience and efficiency, while multi-stakeholder collaboration is critical for industry-wide adoption (Maritime industry accelerates..., 2025).
