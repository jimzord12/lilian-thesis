## **4.4 Maritime Critical Infrastructure Protection**

### Why This Matters

Critical maritime infrastructure—including ports, underwater cables, offshore platforms, and shipping lanes—forms the backbone of the global trade system, enabling the flow of goods, energy, and digital information (MARSEC-COE, 2023). The disruption or compromise of this infrastructure, whether by cyber or physical threats, can have far-reaching impacts on supply chains, economic stability, and maritime safety (Liebetrau, 2023). As the maritime sector undergoes digital transformation, safeguarding this infrastructure is not only a matter of national security but also vital for the resilience of international commerce in an increasingly interconnected world (MARSEC-COE, 2023; Liebetrau, 2023).

### Literature Review and Background

Research on maritime critical infrastructure protection (MCIP) has proliferated in response to new threats arising from digitalization and geopolitical tensions (Liebetrau, 2023). Foundational studies highlight the vulnerability of maritime assets to both cyber and physical attacks, noting that infrastructure such as ports and subsea cables are increasingly targeted by sophisticated adversaries, including nation-states and criminal groups (Cyble, 2025). Key international organizations, such as NATO and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), have initiated guidelines, task forces, and cooperative exercises to foster resilience (O’Dwyer, 2023). Historical case studies, including the Maersk cyber incident and attacks on GPS services, have catalyzed advances in awareness, regulation, and multi-national collaboration (MARSEC-COE, 2023).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Protecting maritime critical infrastructure faces unique constraints: long supply chains, isolated and unmanned assets, legacy technologies, and complex stakeholder ecosystems (BIMCO et al., 2024). Cyberthreats exploit operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) convergence, weak segmentation, insufficient patching cycles, and human factors such as low cybersecurity awareness among crews (MARSEC-COE, 2023). Physical challenges include vast geographic dispersion and difficult-to-monitor underwater assets (Liebetrau, 2023). Uncoordinated response frameworks and gaps in information sharing further hinder rapid mitigation, particularly in multi-jurisdictional environments (Liebetrau, 2023).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Today’s MCIP strategies leverage risk assessment tools, cybersecurity standards (e.g., IMO ISM Code integration), and advanced incident response plans encompassing preparation, detection, containment, eradication, and recovery phases (IASME, 2025). Digital twins and situational awareness platforms facilitate monitoring, while collaborative ecosystems such as the PRECINCT platform allow for the integration of cyber-physical security measures across domains (PRECINCT, 2024). The deployment of unmanned vehicles (USVs/UUVs) enhances surveillance and security operations, especially for high-risk or remote areas (EEAS, 2025). Multi-national exercises, such as MARSEC EU 25, reinforce coordinated response capabilities and the application of best practices (EEAS, 2025).

### Applications and Use Cases

MCIP frameworks have demonstrated efficacy in port security operations, subsea cable resilience, and protection of energy supply lines such as LNG terminals (MARSEC-COE, 2023). Lessons from incidents like the Maersk attack have led to the adoption of resilient backup systems and cross-sector cyber drills (PRECINCT, 2024). Data-driven risk mapping and automation in threat detection support proactive responses to evolving threats (O’Dwyer, 2023). Case studies highlight the benefits of cooperation between public sector agencies, private operators, and international bodies for rapid incident resolution and the safeguarding of global trade (Liebetrau, 2023).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Ongoing research priorities include the development of more adaptive, risk-driven resilience methodologies, improved OT/IT integration strategies, and advanced training programs targeting crew cyber-awareness (BIMCO et al., 2024). There is also an emerging focus on the use of artificial intelligence for automated anomaly detection and the creation of joint EU-NATO frameworks to coordinate rapid response across geopolitical boundaries (EEAS, 2025). A persistent gap exists in developing threat intelligence and information sharing tailored for hybrid and cross-border maritime threats, especially for energy infrastructure and data cables (Liebetrau, 2023).
