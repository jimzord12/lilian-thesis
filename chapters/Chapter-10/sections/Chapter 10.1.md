## **Section 10.1: 6G Maritime Applications and Opportunities**

### Why This Matters

The implementation of 6G in maritime sectors is important because it promises global, seamless, and ultra-reliable communications at sea, enabling advanced services such as autonomous navigation, smart ports, and massive maritime IoT deployments (Xylouris et al., 2024; Zetas et al., 2024; Han et al., 2025).

### Literature Review and Background

Recent research has shown that 6G networks are expected to bring high-speed, low-latency, and intelligent connectivity to maritime environments by integrating terrestrial, non-terrestrial (NTN), and underwater network segments (Xylouris et al., 2024; Zetas et al., 2024). Studies describe how enabling technologies like AI, federated learning, and UAV/USV relaying are being studied extensively to tackle current communication limitations and support complex maritime operations (Han et al., 2025).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Key technical challenges include harsh and unpredictable sea conditions, high path loss, difficulty providing continuous coverage offshore, network scalability, energy efficiency, privacy for distributed learning, and ensuring ultra-low latency across hybrid satellite-terrestrial-aerial infrastructures (Xylouris et al., 2024; Zetas et al., 2024; Han et al., 2025).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

State-of-the-art solutions include integrating AI-driven network management, UAV relaying, and federated learning with over-the-air computation to optimize communication and collaborative model training across distributed nodes (Zetas et al., 2024). Hybrid network architectures—combining terrestrial, satellite, and aerial platforms—are being developed to guarantee continuous connectivity, manage resources efficiently, and improve data privacy (Xylouris et al., 2024; Han et al., 2025).

### Applications and Use Cases

6G enables new services in:

* Smart ports with interconnected, real-time sensing for automation and security (Xylouris et al., 2024\)  
* Autonomous and remote vessel navigation with robust control and remote diagnostics (Zetas et al., 2024\)  
* UAV-assisted sensing for search and rescue, oceanographic monitoring, and regulatory compliance  
* Predictive maintenance and smart logistics using edge AI for timely fault detection and resource planning (Han et al., 2025\)

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Further research is needed to develop robust channel models for maritime environments, scale ML techniques for privacy and efficiency, and test seamless integration of heterogeneous network segments (Han et al., 2025). Pilot projects and regulatory harmonization are required for interoperability and full-scale deployment (Xylouris et al., 2024; Zetas et al., 2024).
