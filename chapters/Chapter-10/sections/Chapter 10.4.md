## **Section 10.4: Maritime Augmented Reality Applications**

### Why This Matters

Maritime Augmented Reality (AR) applications have become increasingly important for advancing safety, efficiency, and situational awareness at sea (van den Oever et al., 2025; Battineni et al., 2024). The maritime industry faces unique operational risks, remote environments, and high-stakes teamwork, making AR an essential technology for supporting navigation, communication, and maintenance (van den Oever et al., 2025; Battineni et al., 2024).

### Literature Review and Background

Recent literature highlights that AR is used in maritime navigation, ship maintenance, and medical support, integrating real-time sensor data and live video overlays to boost operator cognition and support complex tasks (Battineni et al., 2024; Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024). The combination of AI and AR in maritime medicine offers remote guidance, training, and emergency management aboard ships, while field studies demonstrate improved situation awareness, reduced cognitive workload, and enhanced team collaboration using collaborative AR systems (van den Oever et al., 2025; Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Major challenges for maritime AR include high costs for robust hardware, technical limitations in lighting and marker recognition, and the need to integrate AR tools with legacy vessels’ systems (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024). Additional barriers are related to usability, technology acceptance among seafarers, and preventing cognitive overload from excessive or poorly designed AR information (van den Oever et al., 2025). The maritime context amplifies challenges due to dynamic environments, extreme weather, and regulatory uncertainty (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

State-of-the-art AR systems in maritime contexts include Microsoft HoloLens headsets, mobile device AR, and architectures using fog and edge computing to support real-time overlays and remote collaborations (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Marinov, 2024). Smart glasses project navigation charts, warning markers, and sensor data into crew members’ fields of view, helping with real-time decision-making and reducing error rates. Advanced AR prototypes now enable multi-user collaboration, live annotation, and remote expert support for repairs and inspections (van den Oever et al., 2025; Marinov, 2024).

### Applications and Use Cases

Pilot projects have demonstrated AR navigation overlays during low-visibility sailing, on-board maintenance guidance using interactive 3D models, and crew training with simulated emergencies (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Mallam et al., 2019). Maritime medicine applications include remote AR-assisted diagnosis and training for ship doctors, especially during long passages where direct consultation is impossible (Battineni et al., 2024). Real-world tests also show that AR can improve safety-critical communication, reduce technical errors, and aid collaboration for bridge teams navigating congested waterways (van den Oever et al., 2025; Marinov, 2024).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Future research should focus on affordable, weather-proof AR devices for vessels, refined user interfaces that lower cognitive workload, and strong data security frameworks to protect sensitive operational and health data (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024). There is also a need for harmonized international standards, more accessible training, and scalable AR systems that integrate seamlessly with IoT and digital twin platforms for smart shipping (Mallam et al., 2019; van den Oever et al., 2025).
