## **Section 10.5: Distributed Ledger Technology for Shipping**

### Why This Matters

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is increasingly important for the shipping industry because it offers transparent, reliable, and tamper-resistant transaction records across stakeholders (Vujičić et al., 2020; Farah et al., 2024). This capacity supports the need for secure data sharing, efficient operations, and improved trust in maritime logistics (Vujičić et al., 2020).

### Literature Review and Background

DLT enables decentralized and synchronized transaction records, reducing manual paperwork and the risks of fraud or data loss in shipping (Farah et al., 2024; Henríquez Larrazábal, 2022). Major actors such as Maersk and IBM have tested platforms like TradeLens, showing practical benefits for digital documents and workflow automation (Vujičić et al., 2020). Researchers have highlighted DLT’s role in addressing data integrity and compliance requirements for international shipping (Liu et al., 2023).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Applying DLT to maritime shipping faces barriers such as combining new ledger systems with traditional infrastructures and handling privacy versus transparency trade-offs (Liu et al., 2023; Farah et al., 2024). Other technical limitations include scaling blockchain networks for large, distributed supply chains, as well as ensuring regulatory acceptance and interoperability worldwide (Henríquez Larrazábal, 2022). Shipping also requires low-latency solutions, which is still difficult with some DLT systems because of processing loads and connectivity constraints (Liu et al., 2023).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Shipping firms use both private (permissioned) and public blockchain systems to automate transaction validation and document sharing (Farah et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). TradeLens, for example, helps share electronic bills of lading and customs data, reducing waiting times and human errors (Farah et al., 2024). Smart contracts are now used to trigger payments, check compliance, and record cargo status as events happen, improving operational efficiency (Liu et al., 2023).

### Applications and Use Cases

DLT is used in shipping for digital document exchange, automated port and supply chain operations, and real-time compliance monitoring (Vujičić et al., 2020; Quigley et al., 2025). In practice, platforms like TradeLens have shown faster clearance, reduced paperwork, and better tracking for stakeholders (Vujičić et al., 2020). Other cases include using blockchain to collect environmental data and prove compliance with regulatory frameworks (Quigley et al., 2025).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Ongoing research targets integrating DLT with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, better privacy solutions, and regulatory alignment for smoother cross-border trade (Quigley et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023). Unsolved issues include scaling up to support global fleets, reducing DLT overhead, and verifying performance in real maritime operations. There is also a continuing need for international regulations to catch up with technical progress (Quigley et al., 2025).
