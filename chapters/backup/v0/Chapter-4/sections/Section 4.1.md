## **4.1 Maritime Operational Technology (OT) Security**

### Why This Matters

Operational Technology (OT) systems control key ship functions like navigation and engine operations. These systems are vital for safe maritime activities. Cyber threats to OT can cause major disruptions, such as delays in global trade or safety risks. As ships become more connected, protecting OT is key to prevent attacks that affect both operations and the environment. This section looks at OT security in maritime settings to show its role in overall IoT systems (International Maritime Organization, 2022; BIMCO et al., 2024).

### Literature Review and Background

OT in maritime includes systems like SCADA that monitor and control ship processes. Early OT systems were separate and used custom protocols for security through limited access. Over time, these systems connected more to IT networks for better data sharing. Studies show that this change has increased cyber risks, as OT was not built for online threats. Key works highlight how legacy OT equipment lacks updates, making it open to attacks. Historical reviews note that maritime OT evolved from basic controls to integrated digital systems, but security often lagged behind (Stouffer et al., 2023; BIMCO et al., 2024).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Maritime OT faces unique problems due to harsh sea conditions and remote locations. Legacy systems often have old software with known flaws that hackers can use. Integration with IT creates paths for attacks to move from office networks to control systems. Limited onboard support means crews handle both IT and OT without expert help. Common issues include weak network setup, which allows malware to spread, and poor access controls that let unauthorized users in. These challenges are worse in isolated operations where real-time help is not available (International Maritime Organization, 2022; BIMCO et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Current methods focus on segmentation to separate OT from IT networks. Tools like firewalls and monitoring systems help detect threats early. Some approaches use zero-trust models, where every access is checked. Intrusion detection systems watch for odd patterns in OT data. Comparative studies show that combining these with regular updates reduces risks. Architectures now include air-gapped setups for critical systems to block remote attacks (Stouffer et al., 2023; International Maritime Organization, 2022).

### Applications and Use Cases

OT security is used in real-world cases like protecting navigation systems on cargo ships. For example, tanker vessels apply segmentation to guard propulsion controls, leading to fewer disruptions. Performance data from these cases show better response times during threats. Success stories include ports using monitoring tools to stop ransomware, saving costs and time. Lessons from these show the need for crew training to handle OT issues effectively (BIMCO et al., 2024; Stouffer et al., 2023).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Future work should aim at AI-based tools for threat prediction in OT. Gaps exist in handling distributed systems across ships and ports. Emerging trends include blockchain for secure data sharing. Open questions focus on making OT resilient to new attacks like AI-driven ones. Research should explore better training for crews on OT security (International Maritime Organization, 2022; BIMCO et al., 2024).
