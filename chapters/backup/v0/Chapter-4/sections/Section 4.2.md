## **4.2 Ship-to-Shore Cyber Threat Models**

### Why This Matters

## Ship-to-shore digital links are a backbone of global maritime operations, ensuring vessels communicate efficiently with port authorities, corporate offices, and vital logistics systems. As vessels increasingly rely on integrated IT and OT networks, these pathways have become a major target for cyberattacks. Disruptions to these connections can halt port operations, impact global trade, and introduce significant safety and environmental hazards, making robust threat modeling essential for the maritime IoT ecosystem (US Coast Guard, 2024; BIMCO et al., 2024).

### Literature Review and Background

## Recent research highlights both the growth and complexity of cyber threats facing ship-to-shore communications. Early studies identified risks in navigation and bridge systems, but today's expanded attack surface covers cargo, propulsion, and administrative platforms as well. Reports from international and national agencies emphasize that attackers can exploit both remote and physical vectors. Modern frameworks, such as NIST CSF and MaCRA, are now applied to guide systematic risk assessment, integrating governance, asset management, and vulnerability evaluation across maritime domains (Li et al., 2024; Hopcraft et al., 2024; US Coast Guard, 2024).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

## Maritime systems face unique technical challenges: legacy equipment, varied software versions, and limited onboard cybersecurity expertise hinder resilience. Ship-to-shore integration exposes these platforms to wider attack vectors, such as malware from shore-based enterprise networks, or supply chain attacks via third-party vendors. Social engineering and human error remain constant risks, while inconsistent regulation and slow patch cycles further amplify vulnerabilities. Notably, shipboard operational staff often operate without real-time cybersecurity support or incident response capabilities (US Coast Guard, 2024; Li et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

## Modern threat modeling in the maritime sector employs comprehensive frameworks, such as STRIDE, STPA-Sec, CORAS, and MaCRA, to analyze risks from both technical and operational perspectives. These models help identify threats and prioritize mitigation, using asset mapping, attack path discovery, and risk quantification. The use of AI-driven intrusion detection, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring has increased. Government and industry guidelines, like those from the IMO and BIMCO, provide standardized protocols for risk management and vulnerability assessment (BIMCO et al., 2024; Hopcraft et al., 2024; Sahay et al., 2022).

### Applications and Use Cases

## Threat models are applied in practice for vulnerability assessments, attack simulation, and real incident response. For example, they support security drills, improve crew training against phishing, and inform decision-making during ransomware events that disrupt ship-to-shore cranes or bridge control systems. The US Coast Guard and international partners use these models in annual security audits and industry safety reports, identifying trends and rapidly evolving attack vectors such as targeted attacks on cloud-based vessel management (US Coast Guard, 2024; BIMCO et al., 2024).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

## Future maritime cyber threat models must address the proliferation of autonomous vessels, quantum-safe communication requirements, and new forms of cloud-based infrastructure. Research is needed on fast, dynamic adaptation to shifting threats, and on models that integrate both IT and OT perspectives in real time. Global regulatory harmonization and personnel training remain open areas for innovation and development (Li et al., 2024; Hopcraft et al., 2024).
