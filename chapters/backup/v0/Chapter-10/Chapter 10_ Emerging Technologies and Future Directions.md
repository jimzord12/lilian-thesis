# Chapter 10: Emerging Technologies and Future Directions

## **Overview**

The Maritime Internet of Things or MIoT is now in its transition period. The industry is saying goodbye to the familiar internet and The Maritime Internet of Things or MIoT is already past its transitional phase. The industry is abandoning its conventional internet connections to adopt the deep tech systems that will totally transform the functioning of ships and other sea activities. This section examines the recent findings in the field of maritime technology, describing the methods by which the new technology can provide more rapid data transmission and superior security and the ability to interact with AI. These projects represent the next stage of development following the standardization discussed in Chapter 9. Vessels will be equipped with artificial intelligence to make decisions, maintain superior security and safety and adapt to fresh circumstances.

The analysis is divided into five major branches; Section 10.1 discusses the way 6G combines land, air, and satellite networks into global coverage. Section 10.2 investigates Maritime Quantum Communications, which are considered the most effective cyber security since time immemorial. Section 10.3 discusses Neuromorphic Computing, which uses brain-based designs to power autonomous vessels in real-time. Section 10.4 investigates Maritime Augmented Reality (AR) to augment human awareness and remote cooperation. Finally, Section 10.5 discusses Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in terms of secure and transparent supply information.
The aim is to show how the technologies discussed may be linked to resolve the naval problem of delay, energy shortage and trust. With ultra-reliable 6G communication, quantum encryption and neuromorphic edge processing, ships attain a much more powerful automated nature than ever before. The system integration enables the naval force to operate proactively, to forecast and to correct several system operations within the system rather than just responding to problems.

This chapter has developed the interoperability standards established in Chapter 9 and defined the technological horizon which defines the future state of the MIoT. It gives the forward-looking technical basis that is required for the final combination of integration problems and research opportunities that are described in Chapter 11.

## **10.2: Maritime Quantum Communications**

### **Why This Matters**

Maritime quantum communications offer unprecedented security and data protection, which are essential for critical ship-to-shore operations and remote maritime IoT deployments (Lazzarin et al., 2024). These advancements address growing threats to maritime cyber infrastructure and open new possibilities for ultra-secure, reliable global connectivity in ocean industries (DrishtiIAS, 2023).

### **Literature Review and Background**

Quantum communications harness fundamental physics to enable secure data exchange, most notably through quantum key distribution (QKD), which guarantees security based on the laws of quantum mechanics rather than mathematical complexity (Ji et al., 2017; Meena & Banerjee, 2024). Recent literature demonstrates that quantum states, including entangled photons, can survive transmission in seawater, verified in both lab tests and simulation frameworks for shallow and deep-sea channels (Ji et al., 2017; Meena & Banerjee, 2024). Maritime research highlights quantum technology’s role in defense, sensor networks, and infrastructure protection, pointing toward broader application in vessel operations and underwater networks (Huang et al., 2019).

### **Technical Challenges and Issues**

Implementing quantum communications in maritime environments presents unique technical barriers. Seawater introduces high photon attenuation, scattering, and turbulence, reducing transmission distances and increasing error rates (Meena & Banerjee, 2024). Background light, chromatic dispersion, and imperfect optical components further complicate underwater and surface quantum channels, impacting both the efficiency of QKD and the fidelity of quantum signals (Huang et al., 2019). Practical deployment requires overcoming obstacles in photon source generation, detector sensitivity, and environmental variability caused by tides, salinity, and vessel movement (Lazzarin et al., 2024).

### **Current Technologies and Approaches**

Existing maritime quantum communication systems integrate optical, acoustic, and quantum satellite links to improve secure key distribution among ships, buoys, and autonomous vehicles (Lazzarin et al., 2024). Surface nodes use quantum terminals for QKD and may relay keys to underwater assets using direct optical communication links, which can be updated by autonomous underwater vehicles. Advances in photon shaping, modulation, and noise rejection have enabled robust QKD even in noise-dense oceanic environments (Ji et al., 2017; Lazzarin et al., 2024). Hybrid communication networks, combining quantum encryption with conventional satellite and radio systems, enhance both reliability and security for critical maritime operations (DrishtiIAS, 2023).

### **Applications and Use Cases**

Field demonstrations show quantum key distribution provides reliable and confidential communications for autonomous vessels, sensor arrays, and ship-to-shore links (Lazzarin et al., 2024). Quantum sensors bolster precision navigation by measuring Earth’s magnetic field with high accuracy, supporting safety in narrow channels and hazardous regions (DrishtiIAS, 2023). Underwater QKD networks are used for secure submarine data transfer, ocean infrastructure monitoring, and safeguarding oceanographic research missions (Ji et al., 2017).

### **Future Directions and Research Gaps**

Ongoing studies seek to optimize quantum communication channels for longer distances and more complex maritime scenarios, exploring new photon sources, advanced error correction, and mobile node architectures (Meena & Banerjee, 2024). Open research questions include scaling quantum networks for global ship fleets, integrating quantum sensors in harsh ocean conditions, and combining quantum technologies with emerging 6G networks for ultra-resilient maritime IoT (Lazzarin et al., 2024; DrishtiIAS, 2023). Greater standardization of protocols, regulatory solutions, and the development of cost-effective, miniaturized quantum hardware remain future priorities.

## **10.3: Neuromorphic Computing for Autonomous Ships**

### **Why This Matters**

Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological mechanisms of the human brain, brings real-time, energy-efficient data processing to autonomous ships, supporting advanced decision-making and perception in dynamic marine environments (Marchisio & Shafique, 2025). This paradigm is vital for the further development of maritime autonomy, enabling ships to operate safely and efficiently with limited human input (TutorialsPoint, 2025).

### **Literature Review and Background**

Recent studies underline the growing role of neuromorphic computing in autonomous systems, where architectures mimicking neural processes offer major benefits such as parallel information handling and low energy requirements (Marchisio & Shafique, 2025). Notably, maritime research initiatives have begun applying neuromorphic sensor-processor systems to enhance vessel situational awareness, especially for applications requiring continuous monitoring and robust multi-sensor integration (Western Sydney University, 2025). For instance, autonomous driving research demonstrates that spiking neural networks on neuromorphic processors can perform competitively with traditional computing at lower energy costs, providing guidelines applicable for control and navigation tasks on autonomous vessels (Halaly & Ezra Tsur, 2023).

### **Technical Challenges and Issues**

Deploying neuromorphic computing on autonomous ships involves challenges such as integrating with a variety of marine sensors, handling unpredictable conditions, and maintaining reliable operation despite environmental noise (Western Sydney University, 2025). An additional issue lies in building secure and trustworthy systems for critical ship operations, as current architectures face difficulties in real-time adaptation and validation for maritime safety requirements (Marchisio & Shafique, 2025). Guidelines from neuromorphic controller research emphasize the importance of tuning neural parameters for stability and adaptability, which is a central issue when moving from land to maritime domains (Halaly & Ezra Tsur, 2023).

### **Current Technologies and Approaches**

Neuromorphic technologies in maritime settings now focus on processing environmental sensor streams, such as visual, auditory, and radar data, enabling real-time tasks like navigation, object recognition, and collision avoidance (TutorialsPoint, 2025). There are active projects, such as those at Western Sydney University, working on neuromorphic processors for continuous data fusion and situational assessment, emphasizing fast responses and reduced energy needs (Western Sydney University, 2025). Evidence from vehicle autonomy research points to spiking neural network controllers that converge on optimal behavior with relatively few neurons and highlight the value of hybrid architectures combining both traditional and neuromorphic elements (Halaly & Ezra Tsur, 2023).

### **Applications and Use Cases**

Applications of neuromorphic computing in the maritime sector include improved situational awareness, object detection, and dynamic navigation for autonomous ships and underwater vehicles (Western Sydney University, 2025). Neuromorphic processors have enabled reliable long-duration operation with low power consumption, which is crucial for both surface and underwater platforms. Additionally, real-time environmental adaptation for safety tasks benefits directly from the rapid response and energy efficiency of these brain-inspired systems (TutorialsPoint, 2025; Halaly & Ezra Tsur, 2023).

### **Future Directions and Research Gaps**

Future work in neuromorphic maritime systems should focus on more robust and secure architectures that enable continual adaptation and learning with minimal human supervision (Marchisio & Shafique, 2025). Other key areas include harmonizing neuromorphic and traditional computing for improved efficiency and developing explainable AI frameworks to build regulatory and operational trust. Emphasis should also be placed on standardizing interfaces for sensor and control integration and validating adaptive neuromorphic algorithms in diverse and unpredictable marine environments (Halaly & Ezra Tsur, 2023).

## **10.4: Maritime Augmented Reality Applications**

### **Why This Matters**

Maritime Augmented Reality (AR) applications have become increasingly important for advancing safety, efficiency, and situational awareness at sea (van den Oever et al., 2025; Battineni et al., 2024). The maritime industry faces unique operational risks, remote environments, and high-stakes teamwork, making AR an essential technology for supporting navigation, communication, and maintenance (van den Oever et al., 2025; Battineni et al., 2024).

### **Literature Review and Background**

Recent literature highlights that AR is used in maritime navigation, ship maintenance, and medical support, integrating real-time sensor data and live video overlays to boost operator cognition and support complex tasks (Battineni et al., 2024; Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024). The combination of AI and AR in maritime medicine offers remote guidance, training, and emergency management aboard ships, while field studies demonstrate improved situation awareness, reduced cognitive workload, and enhanced team collaboration using collaborative AR systems (van den Oever et al., 2025; Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024).

### **Technical Challenges and Issues**

Major challenges for maritime AR include high costs for robust hardware, technical limitations in lighting and marker recognition, and the need to integrate AR tools with legacy vessels’ systems (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024). Additional barriers are related to usability, technology acceptance among seafarers, and preventing cognitive overload from excessive or poorly designed AR information (van den Oever et al., 2025). The maritime context amplifies challenges due to dynamic environments, extreme weather, and regulatory uncertainty (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024).

### **Current Technologies and Approaches**

State-of-the-art AR systems in maritime contexts include Microsoft HoloLens headsets, mobile device AR, and architectures using fog and edge computing to support real-time overlays and remote collaborations (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Marinov, 2024). Smart glasses project navigation charts, warning markers, and sensor data into crew members’ fields of view, helping with real-time decision-making and reducing error rates. Advanced AR prototypes now enable multi-user collaboration, live annotation, and remote expert support for repairs and inspections (van den Oever et al., 2025; Marinov, 2024).

### **Applications and Use Cases**

Pilot projects have demonstrated AR navigation overlays during low-visibility sailing, on-board maintenance guidance using interactive 3D models, and crew training with simulated emergencies (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Mallam et al., 2019). Maritime medicine applications include remote AR-assisted diagnosis and training for ship doctors, especially during long passages where direct consultation is impossible (Battineni et al., 2024). Real-world tests also show that AR can improve safety-critical communication, reduce technical errors, and aid collaboration for bridge teams navigating congested waterways (van den Oever et al., 2025; Marinov, 2024).

### **Future Directions and Research Gaps**

Future research should focus on affordable, weather-proof AR devices for vessels, refined user interfaces that lower cognitive workload, and strong data security frameworks to protect sensitive operational and health data (Blanco-Novoa et al., 2024; Battineni et al., 2024). There is also a need for harmonized international standards, more accessible training, and scalable AR systems that integrate seamlessly with IoT and digital twin platforms for smart shipping (Mallam et al., 2019; van den Oever et al., 2025).

## **10.5: Distributed Ledger Technology for Shipping**

### **Why This Matters**

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is increasingly important for the shipping industry because it offers transparent, reliable, and tamper-resistant transaction records across stakeholders (Vujičić et al., 2020; Farah et al., 2024). This capacity supports the need for secure data sharing, efficient operations, and improved trust in maritime logistics (Vujičić et al., 2020).

### **Literature Review and Background**

DLT enables decentralized and synchronized transaction records, reducing manual paperwork and the risks of fraud or data loss in shipping (Farah et al., 2024; Henríquez Larrazábal, 2022). Major actors such as Maersk and IBM have tested platforms like TradeLens, showing practical benefits for digital documents and workflow automation (Vujičić et al., 2020). Researchers have highlighted DLT’s role in addressing data integrity and compliance requirements for international shipping (Liu et al., 2023).

### **Technical Challenges and Issues**

Applying DLT to maritime shipping faces barriers such as combining new ledger systems with traditional infrastructures and handling privacy versus transparency trade-offs (Liu et al., 2023; Farah et al., 2024). Other technical limitations include scaling blockchain networks for large, distributed supply chains, as well as ensuring regulatory acceptance and interoperability worldwide (Henríquez Larrazábal, 2022). Shipping also requires low-latency solutions, which is still difficult with some DLT systems because of processing loads and connectivity constraints (Liu et al., 2023).

### **Current Technologies and Approaches**

Shipping firms use both private (permissioned) and public blockchain systems to automate transaction validation and document sharing (Farah et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). TradeLens, for example, helps share electronic bills of lading and customs data, reducing waiting times and human errors (Farah et al., 2024). Smart contracts are now used to trigger payments, check compliance, and record cargo status as events happen, improving operational efficiency (Liu et al., 2023).

### **Applications and Use Cases**

DLT is used in shipping for digital document exchange, automated port and supply chain operations, and real-time compliance monitoring (Vujičić et al., 2020; Quigley et al., 2025). In practice, platforms like TradeLens have shown faster clearance, reduced paperwork, and better tracking for stakeholders (Vujičić et al., 2020). Other cases include using blockchain to collect environmental data and prove compliance with regulatory frameworks (Quigley et al., 2025).

### **Future Directions and Research Gaps**

Ongoing research targets integrating DLT with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, better privacy solutions, and regulatory alignment for smoother cross-border trade (Quigley et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2023). Unsolved issues include scaling up to support global fleets, reducing DLT overhead, and verifying performance in real maritime operations. There is also a continuing need for international regulations to catch up with technical progress (Quigley et al., 2025).
