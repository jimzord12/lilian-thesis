## 1.3 Research Scope and Objectives

### 1.3.1 Research Scope

The scope of this thesis is centered on defining the architectural and functional boundaries of the **Maritime Internet of Things (MIoT)**. It distinguishes MIoT from conventional terrestrial IoT by addressing the unique challenges of the maritime environment, including intermittent connectivity, high latency, energy scarcity, and extreme physical conditions. Unlike previous research that often focuses on isolated technologies—such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) or specific satellite protocols—this work adopts a holistic approach. It investigates the convergence of **Operational Technology (OT)** and **Information Technology (IT)** across the entire maritime value chain. The scope encompasses the complete data lifecycle, spanning physical sensing (underwater and surface), heterogeneous transmission networks, edge/cloud processing, and high-level applications such as autonomous navigation and digital twins.

### 1.3.2 Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review and a novel taxonomy for the MIoT ecosystem. To achieve this, the study is structured around four specific objectives:

1.  **Develop a Layered Taxonomy**: To synthesize the fragmented maritime technology landscape into a cohesive framework. This framework categorizes systems into Sensing, Communication, Computation, and Application layers, elucidating the interdependencies between Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) and satellite backbones.
2.  **Evaluate Critical Enablers and Constraints**: To assess the technological maturity of core pillars—such as 6G integration, edge computing, and blockchain-based security—within the context of maritime operations. This objective aims to bridge the "gap" between theoretical academic models and practical industrial deployment.
3.  **Synthesize Security and Sustainability Frameworks**: To investigate the integration of resilient cybersecurity architectures (e.g., Zero Trust) and green energy harvesting techniques. The focus is on ensuring that MIoT systems are designed for both operational resilience and compliance with global standards, such as the IMO 2050 decarbonization goals.
4.  **Identify Future Research Trajectories**: To systematically map existing knowledge gaps, with a particular emphasis on standardization, semantic interoperability, and the evolution from automated systems to fully autonomous "deep tech" maritime operations.
