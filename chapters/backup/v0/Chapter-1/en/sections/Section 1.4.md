## 1.4 Review Methodology

To ensure the rigor and reproducibility of this state-of-the-art review, a **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** methodology was adopted. This approach adheres to the principles of transparency and comprehensive coverage, specifically designed to filter the vast volume of general IoT literature and isolate contributions pertinent to the maritime domain.

### 1.4.1 Search Strategy

A structured keyword search was executed across high-impact scientific databases, including **IEEE Xplore**, **Scopus**, **Web of Science**, and the **ACM Digital Library**. To capture the full breadth of the ecosystem, search strings combined core domains with specific maritime applications:

- **Primary Keywords**: "Maritime Internet of Things," "Internet of Ships," "Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN)," and "Maritime Cyber-Physical Systems."
- **Secondary Keywords (Contextual)**: "Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MASS)," "Maritime Digital Twin," "Oceanic 6G," "Smart Ports," and "Edge Computing at Sea."

### 1.4.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Given the rapid pace of technological evolution, strict criteria were applied to maintain the currency and relevance of the analyzed works:

- **Timeframe**: The review prioritizes literature published between **2020 and 2025**. This window captures the "post-digitalization" wave, characterized by the shift from basic digitization to intelligent, AI-driven systems. Foundational papers prior to 2020 were included only if they defined seminal standards or protocols (e.g., JANUS or early AIS specifications).
- **Language and Type**: Inclusion was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and official technical reports from standardizing bodies (e.g., **IMO, ISO, IEC, IACS**) published in English.
- **Relevance**: Articles focusing purely on commercial logistics without a technical IoT component, or terrestrial IoT studies with only tangential references to maritime environments, were excluded.

### 1.4.3 Data Synthesis

The selected literature was categorized according to the **"Seven Pillars"** framework established in this thesis. This thematic analysis facilitated the synthesis of disparate studies—ranging from physical layer acoustics to application layer cyber-risk modeling—into a unified narrative that reflects the current state and future trajectory of the Maritime Internet of Things.
