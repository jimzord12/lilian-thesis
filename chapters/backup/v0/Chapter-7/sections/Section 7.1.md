## **Section 7.1: Maritime Big Data Analytics Platforms**

### Why This Matters

Big data analytics platforms help the maritime industry improve decision-making, safety, and efficiency by using information from ships, ports, and sensors (Lytra et al., 2017; Sedna, n.d.).

### Literature Review and Background

Digital technologies have led to a large growth in maritime data from sources like the Automatic Identification System (AIS), satellites, and onboard sensors (Lytra et al., 2017). Early research focused on tracking vessels and monitoring coastal areas. Platforms such as BigDataOcean provide tools for handling and analyzing large marine datasets, using technology like artificial intelligence and distributed computing for tasks like fleet monitoring and environmental compliance (BigDataOcean, n.d.; Lytra et al., 2017).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Maritime data comes from many different sources and formats, making it hard to harmonize and clean the datasets (Lytra et al., 2017). Big data solutions must handle large data volumes, high speed, and complex information, all while protecting privacy and meeting regulations. Security and scalability are key concerns when building these analytics platforms (Sedna, n.d.).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Modern analytics platforms use layered designs. One layer gathers and organizes data, another does the analysis using machine learning or statistics, and a third provides dashboards and reports (AMOS, 2025; Lytra et al., 2017). Products like AMOS™ Data Surface and IMOS Data Lake allow users to analyze fleet performance and get insights using tools like artificial intelligence and business intelligence dashboards (AMOS, 2025; IMOS, 2025).

### Applications and Use Cases

Typical applications include:

* Route optimization using weather and vessel data (Sedna, n.d.).  
* Predictive maintenance from onboard sensors (AMOS, 2025).  
* Digital twins for ship simulation and fuel management (Lytra et al., 2017).  
* Business intelligence tools for risk management and regulatory compliance (IMOS, 2025).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Researchers are aiming for more onboard (edge) analytics, better ways to standardize marine data, and privacy-friendly collaborative learning across the industry (Lytra et al., 2017). Work is still needed to make data systems more scalable and able to handle new types of information (BigDataOcean, n.d.; Lytra et al., 2017).
