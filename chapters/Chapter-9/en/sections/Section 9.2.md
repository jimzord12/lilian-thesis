## **Section 9.2: Semantic Interoperability for Maritime Data**

### Why This Matters

Semantic interoperability is essential in maritime data ecosystems because maritime operations rely on integrating data from heterogeneous sources such as ships, ports, regulatory bodies, and ocean sensors (Karagiannis et al., 2023). Without semantic interoperability, data sharing is limited by ambiguities or inconsistencies in meaning, which can undermine accurate decision-making, effective operations, and the realization of new digital services (Borja et al., 2025).

### Literature Review and Background

Recent research has focused on developing ontologies and workflow models that ensure a shared meaning of maritime data across different systems (Fafalios et al., 2023; Karagiannis et al., 2023). Notable advancements include the SeaLiT Ontology, which extends international standards like CIDOC-CRM to support semantic integration of maritime historical data (Fafalios et al., 2023), and the ShipQuest Ontology, which addresses semantic modeling for legal and operational maritime information (Koubarakis et al., 2023). These frameworks address the longstanding challenges of heterogeneous data formats and semantics by leveraging common controlled vocabularies and formal conceptual models.

### Technical Challenges and Issues

The main technical issues involve the heterogeneity of data sources, the lack of universally adopted ontologies, and the continuous evolution of maritime terminologies and data models (Karagiannis et al., 2023; Fafalios et al., 2023). Harmonization of data semantics requires consensus among domain experts from various fields and countries, as well as methods for mapping legacy data to new standards. Technical barriers also arise from multilingual data sources and real-time streaming data, which complicate semantic integration.

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Modern approaches to semantic interoperability emphasize ontology-driven data modeling, Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) representations, and knowledge graphs (Fafalios et al., 2023; Karagiannis et al., 2023). The SeaLiT Ontology demonstrates how archival and operational maritime data can be mapped into a shared semantic network, supporting comprehensive queries and robust data integration (Fafalios et al., 2023). Other solutions, such as the Blue Dataverse, focus on FAIR data principles and interoperable metadata frameworks to allow cross-border and cross-sectoral sharing and use of marine data (Karagiannis et al., 2023).

### Applications and Use Cases

Semantic interoperability frameworks have enabled successful integration of crew lists, naval registries, and maritime contracts across organizations and countries, enhancing research, regulatory oversight, and operational efficiency (Fafalios et al., 2023; Koubarakis et al., 2023). In the Blue Dataverse, interoperable semantic layers support applications in climate research, marine traffic prediction, and ocean monitoring, allowing predictive modeling and collaborative decision-making (Borja et al., 2025; Karagiannis et al., 2023).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Despite significant progress, there are open research needs in developing automated tools for aligning schemas with maritime ontologies and in extending ontology coverage to address the multidisciplinarity of ocean sciences (Borja et al., 2025). Enhancements in AI-assisted metadata generation and semantic entity resolution, as well as continuously evolving ocean data standards, are required for sustainable and scalable semantic interoperability (Borja et al., 2025; Fafalios et al., 2023).
