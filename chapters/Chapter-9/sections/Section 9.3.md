## **Section 9.3: Legacy System Integration Challenges**

### Why This Matters

Integrating legacy systems is a major challenge for maritime IoT because existing ships and port systems often use old technology that was not designed to work with modern digital platforms. Overcoming these integration issues is critical for improving connectivity, efficiency, and gaining the full benefits of maritime IoT solutions (Gabel, 2025; Vibylabs, 2025; Advantum, 2025).

### Literature Review and Background

Many legacy systems in maritime operations were created to work independently, without plans for network access or data sharing. As the maritime industry moves towards digital transformation, these old technologies often do not fit well with current IoT systems. Studies reveal that legacy systems are common in shipping and ports, and they frequently limit progress and digital growth in the sector (Gabel, 2025; Vibylabs, 2025; Advantum, 2025).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Old maritime systems usually depend on unique protocols, outdated formats, and rigid designs. This makes it hard to create reliable interfaces for data sharing or real-time communication. Common issues include data incompatibility, poor scalability, weak security, and expensive maintenance. Trying to connect these systems with modern IoT can lead to slowdowns, higher risks of system failures, and greater costs for upgrades and ongoing support (Vibylabs, 2025; Advantum, 2025).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Current strategies focus on retrofitting old machines with IoT sensors and using middleware, such as gateways, to translate between old and new systems. These solutions allow legacy systems to send data to IoT platforms using standard formats, making integration possible with minimal disruption. Organizations also often use phased migration, gradual upgrades, and open APIs to support interoperability while keeping costs and risks under control (Gabel, 2025; Vibylabs, 2025).

### Applications and Use Cases

Shipping companies and ports have used IoT sensors to monitor older engines and machines. Middleware tools have connected old control systems to cloud platforms, improving maintenance and operations. These projects have made it possible to track assets, automate maintenance, and extend the lifespan of expensive equipment without having to replace everything (Gabel, 2025; Vibylabs, 2025; Advantum, 2025).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Future work should focus on better open-source integration tools, easier data translation, and improved standards for linking legacy equipment with IoT. It is also important to strengthen security and find ways to automate data mapping between old and new formats, helping organizations update their infrastructure with less risk (Gabel, 2025; Vibylabs, 2025; Advantum, 2025).
