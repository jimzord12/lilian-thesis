## **Section 9.1: Maritime IoT Standards Development**

### Why This Matters

The development of standardized frameworks for Maritime IoT is essential to ensure safe, efficient, and interoperable operations on connected vessels and maritime infrastructure worldwide (International Organization for Standardization \[ISO\], 2024). Standards allow information and technology to be reliably exchanged and used, support regulatory compliance, and underpin industry-wide safety and cybersecurity objectives (International Association of Classification Societies \[IACS\], 2023).

### Literature Review and Background

Recent research identifies the evolution of standards as a key component of maritime digitalization, device interoperability, and risk management (ISO, 2024; IACS, 2023). Older technologies such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) laid the groundwork, but new standards like ISO 4891:2024 and IACS Unified Requirements E26/E27 now reflect an industry-wide shift towards embracing smart applications and robust cyber resilience for modern shipping environments (ISO, 2024; IACS, 2023; Ko, 2021). These frameworks are increasingly developed by collaborative efforts among international standards organizations and maritime regulatory bodies.

### Technical Challenges and Issues

Major technical challenges to harmonized IoT standardization include the need for backward compatibility with existing shipboard systems, fragmented regulatory approaches across regions, and the rapid pace of emerging cyber threats (ISO, 2024; IACS, 2023). Maritime environments present unique issues such as prolonged equipment lifecycles, sporadic connectivity, and variable operational contexts, making it difficult to implement, verify, and keep standards up to date (Ko, 2021; Xylouris et al., 2024).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Recent initiatives have formalized industry-wide adoption of interoperability and cybersecurity requirements. ISO 4891:2024 specifies requirements for smart applications, documentation, process management, and compliance levels within the maritime sector (ISO, 2024). The IACS UR E26 and E27 set minimum standards for cyber resilience, including mandatory technical and operational measures for ships and onboard equipment (IACS, 2023). These standards are complimented by existing protocols and domain-specific solutions ensuring data security and interoperable communication (ISO, 2024; SINTEF, 2024).

### Applications and Use Cases

Practical applications of Maritime IoT standards are evident in remote container tracking, predictive maintenance, and smart logbook technology. Maersk Line, for example, employs IoT-based container management systems for real-time status tracking and operational efficiency. The Yara Birkeland project demonstrates how standards enable safe and efficient operation of autonomous and fully electric vessels, reducing emissions and supporting remote operations (ISO, 2024; Maritim Education, 2024). These recurring examples show improved compliance, streamlined workflow, and tangible safety benefits.

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Ongoing research emphasises the need for harmonization across various international, regional, and sector-specific standards, improved formalization of data models, and the adoption of scalable cybersecurity frameworks (ISO, 2024; IACS, 2023). Forthcoming standards are expected to integrate AI-driven management, digital twin concepts, and further advancements in risk mitigation. Addressing legacy system barriers and maintaining regulatory agility with technological changes are persistent gaps that require global industry collaboration (Ko, 2021; Xylouris et al., 2024).
