## **Section 7.6: Edge AI for Autonomous Vessels (Revised)**

### Why This Matters

Edge AI enables autonomous vessels to make real-time, safety-critical decisions onboard without relying on constant connectivity, which is often unreliable or high-latency at sea (Tran et al., 2025; Orca AI, 2025). This is crucial given the need for immediate response in dynamic and potentially hazardous maritime environments (Orca AI, 2025).

### Literature Review and Background

Recent research has identified Edge AI as an effective means to deploy advanced analytics and decision-making models directly on ships, allowing for rapid adaptation to changing environmental and operational conditions (Tran et al., 2025). Industry systems such as Orca AI demonstrate this trend by implementing deep learning and sensor fusion to support autonomous navigation, collision avoidance, and operational safety onboard commercial vessels (Orca AI, 2025; Danelec, 2025).

### Technical Challenges and Issues

The application of Edge AI in maritime settings faces significant obstacles, including limitations in onboard computing power, harsh weather and interference, and intermittent or costly connectivity between vessels and cloud systems (Tran et al., 2025). Other issues include the complexity of compressing AI models for edge use and the need to maintain robust cybersecurity within a distributed edge architecture (Tran et al., 2025; Danelec, 2025).

### Current Technologies and Approaches

Modern edge AI approaches in this sector utilize lightweight neural networks, sensor fusion, and distributed optimization to reduce dependence on remote servers (Tran et al., 2025; Danelec, 2025). Platforms like Orca AI’s navigation assistants fuse radar, AIS, and camera inputs to detect and classify risks, while edge-enabled devices such as Danelec Edge process sensor streams locally to provide uninterrupted analytics and predictive maintenance even when offline (Danelec, 2025; Orca AI, 2025).

### Applications and Use Cases

Autonomous ships equipped with edge AI now perform real-time hazard detection, adaptive route planning, and predictive engine monitoring while at sea (Tran et al., 2025; Orca AI, 2025). For example, Orca AI has been used to reduce the risk of marine mammal strikes and vessel collisions by processing sensor data onboard and giving actionable alerts to crews or autonomous navigation systems (Orca AI, 2025).

### Future Directions and Research Gaps

Research continues on improving the efficiency and interpretability of edge AI models for maritime conditions, with an emphasis on explainable AI and more transparent risk grading for regulatory compliance (Tran et al., 2025). Open questions include how to best integrate edge AI systems with emerging international maritime standards and how to expand their role in broader fleet and port operations (Tran et al., 2025).
