# **Final Document Progression Workflow**

## **1. State Analysis**

1. Read `final-document/final-document-workflow.md` to identify the current "Current Task" or the first unchecked item in the priority list.
2. Cross-reference with `chapter-progress-tracker.md` to ensure source materials are ready.

## **2. Execution Logic**

### **If the next task is a Chapter Assembly:**
1. Locate the `Final` version of the chapter (e.g., `-Final.md` or `-Humanized.md`).
2. Read the content and any associated bibliography.
3. If this is the FIRST chapter being added, initialize the final master document (e.g., `Thesis_Final.md`).
4. Append the chapter content to the final master document.
5. Ensure heading levels are adjusted if necessary (Chapter title as #, sections as ##).
6. Update the workflow file: mark the chapter as [x] and set the next chapter as the "Current Task".

### **If the next task is "Bookending" (Introduction or Conclusion):**
1. Perform a full review of the master document content.
2. Generate/Refine the chapter to ensure it aligns perfectly with the synthesized content of the main body.
3. Append/Prepend as appropriate.

### **If the next task is Front/Back Matter:**
1. Generate the required section (Abstract, Abbreviations, etc.).
2. Consolidate bibliographies into the master reference list.

## **3. Quality Controls (STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED)**

- **STOP AFTER ONE CHAPTER:** Do NOT process more than **ONE** major chapter per session. This is a hard constraint to ensure the user can review each addition.
- **WAIT FOR APPROVAL:** After appending a chapter and updating the workflow, stop and ask the user for confirmation before proceeding to the next one.
- **Consistent Style:** Always check for consistent terminology and style across the document.
- **No Duplicates:** Ensure no duplicate "References" headers exist within the body of the master document. All references belong in the master list.

## **4. Reporting**

Summarize what was added and what the user should expect in the next session.
