# **Final Document Initialization Workflow**

## **1. Environment Setup**

1. Create the `final-document/` directory if it doesn't exist.
2. Create the `final-document/assets/` directory.

## **2. Workflow Initialization**

1. Read `thesis-outline.md`.
2. Read `chapter-progress-tracker.md`.
3. Create `final-document/final-document-workflow.md` with the following structure:
   - **Phase 1: Preparation** (Verification of all chapters).
   - **Phase 2: Main Body Assembly** (Chapters 2 to 10).
   - **Phase 3: Bookending** (Finalizing Chapter 1 and Chapter 11).
   - **Phase 4: Front & Back Matter** (Title page, Abstract, Table of Contents, Bibliography).
   - **Phase 5: Polishing & Validation**.

## **3. Convention Alignment**

Ensure the workflow explicitly states that Chapters 1 and 11 are deferred to Phase 3.

## **4. Output**

Confirm the creation of the files and summarize the state of the main body chapters based on the current tracker.
