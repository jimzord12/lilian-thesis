Create a professional technical illustration for an academic thesis on Maritime IoT.

**Type:** System Architecture Diagram
**Style:** Technical illustration, Minimalist, Professional, Blue and White color palette.

**Components to Include:**
- **Space Layer:** LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and MEO satellite constellations.
- **Aerial Layer:** UAVs (Drones) and HAPS (High-Altitude Platform Stations).
- **Surface Layer:** Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs), smart buoys, and coastal 6G base stations with THz antennas.
- **Underwater Layer:** AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) and sensors.
- **Cloud Layer:** A central "Global Maritime Cloud" for data fusion.

**Visual Flow:** Show dotted lines representing THz links between coastal stations and ships, and solid lines for satellite-to-ship/buoy links. Use blue-green light beams for underwater-to-surface optical communication.

**Color Scheme:** Deep ocean blue, sky blue, white, and subtle neon highlights for data links.

**Additional Notes:** Ensure the hierarchy from Space to Undersea is clear and organized.

Requirements:
- Clean, professional academic style
- Clear labels and annotations where appropriate
- High contrast for print readability
- No text overlays unless specifically requested
