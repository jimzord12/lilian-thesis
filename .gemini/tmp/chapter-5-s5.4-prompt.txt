Create a professional technical illustration for an academic thesis on Maritime IoT.

**Type:** Conceptual Infographic / Diagram

**Style:** Modern, illustrative, easy to understand. Using boat icons/silhouettes instead of generic triangles/boids.

**Components to Include:**
*   Three distinct panels or sections, each illustrating one rule:
    1.  **Separation (Collision Avoidance):** Show a central boat steering *away* from crowding neighbors to maintain a safe distance. Use small arrows to show repulsive force.
    2.  **Alignment (Velocity Matching):** Show a central boat adjusting its heading/speed to *match* the average direction of its neighbors. Use parallel arrows to show shared direction.
    3.  **Cohesion (Flock Centering):** Show a central boat steering *towards* the average position (center of mass) of the local group. Use inward arrows towards a center point.

**Visual Flow:**
*   Horizontal layout (Panel 1 | Panel 2 | Panel 3).
*   Each panel should clearly label the rule (Separation, Alignment, Cohesion).
*   Use a "Hero" boat (e.g., blue) interacting with "Neighbor" boats (e.g., gray).

**Color Scheme:**
*   **Boats:** Blue (Self) and Gray (Neighbors).
*   **Force Vectors/Arrows:**
    *   *Separation:* Red (danger/avoid).
    *   *Alignment:* Green (safe/flow).
    *   *Cohesion:* Orange or Purple (grouping).
*   **Water:** Light blue background.

**Additional Notes:** The text references "Russell & Norvig, 2021" for these rules. Ensure the visualization clearly distinguishes between the *direction* (Alignment) and the *position* (Cohesion) adjustments.

Requirements:
- Clean, professional academic style
- Clear labels and annotations where appropriate
- High contrast for print readability
- No text overlays unless specifically requested
