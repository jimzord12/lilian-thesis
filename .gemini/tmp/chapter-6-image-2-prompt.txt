Create a professional technical illustration for an academic thesis on Maritime IoT.

**Type:** Block Diagram

**Style:** Engineering Schematic

**Components to Include:**
- **Microcontroller Block:** Labeled "SAMD20-J Autopilot (DUT)".
- **Simulator Block:** Labeled "Simulink Environment (Host PC)". Internal sub-blocks: "Ship Dynamics", "Wind Model", "Wave Model".
- **Connections:**
    - Arrow from Simulator to Microcontroller: "Simulated GPS/Compass Data".
    - Arrow from Microcontroller to Simulator: "Rudder/Sail Commands (PWM)".

**Visual Flow:** Circular loop flow (Feedback loop).

**Color Scheme:** Professional engineering diagram colors (Greys, Blues, White background). Distinguish Hardware (Physical) from Software (Simulator) using slight color coding (e.g., Grey for Hardware, Blue for Software).

**Additional Notes:** Clean lines, legible font for all labels.

Requirements:
- Clean, professional academic style
- Clear labels and annotations where appropriate
- High contrast for print readability
- No text overlays unless specifically requested
