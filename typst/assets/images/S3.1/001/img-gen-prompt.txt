A professional, technical 3D isometric diagram of an Underwater Wireless Sensor Network (UWSN) architecture. The scene depicts a deep sea environment with several distinct layers. At the bottom, static sensor clusters are deployed on the seabed (sand and rock texture), visualized as small, sleek electronic pods. In the middle water column, there are several vertical profiling nodes suspended by buoys at different depths. A sleek, modern Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is moving through the scene. Translucent cyan-blue lines represent acoustic communication links forming a 3D mesh grid between all elements. On the surface, two smart buoys with solar panels and antennas act as gateways to a satellite in the corner. High-quality blueprint style, clean lines, professional scientific illustration, soft blue gradient background, 4k resolution.
