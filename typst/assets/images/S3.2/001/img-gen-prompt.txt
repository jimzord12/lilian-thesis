A detailed, technical cutaway diagram (blueprint style) of a modern Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), side view. The graphic must reveal the internal modular architecture with perfect technical precision. Key modules to include: 1. A grid-patterned Acoustic Sonar Transducer at the nose. 2. A separate Optical Sensor/Camera module below the nose. 3. A large Lithium-ion Battery Block in the main hull. 4. A high-density PCB Controller/Microprocessor assembly with visible wiring. 5. A brushless motor and propeller system at the tail. Labels in a clean, professional sans-serif font must point to each component with zero spelling errors. Professional engineering aesthetic, minimalist color palette (blue, white, grey), isolated on a white background, sharp edges, high technical fidelity.
