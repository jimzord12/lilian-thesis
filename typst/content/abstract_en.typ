The maritime industry is undergoing a profound digital transformation, evolving from traditional operations towards the "Maritime 4.0" paradigm. Central to this evolution is the Maritime Internet of Things (MIoT), a sophisticated ecosystem that integrates advanced sensing, communication, and intelligence technologies to enhance operational efficiency, safety, and sustainability. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the MIoT landscape, systematically exploring its multi-layered architecture—from the physical perception of underwater and surface environments to the high-level virtual intelligence driven by Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence.

The research investigates the critical connectivity layer, evaluating the integration of Software-Defined Networks (SDN), Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), and the transition towards 6G to overcome the unique challenges of maritime geographical isolation. Furthermore, it examines the role of autonomous systems, including Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) and Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), in reducing human error—the primary cause of maritime accidents. The study also addresses the imperative of "Trust" within the MIoT ecosystem, analyzing robust cybersecurity frameworks and green IoT initiatives aimed at reducing the industry's carbon footprint and ensuring regulatory compliance with IMO/ITU standards.

By synthesizing state-of-the-art developments across communication, sensing, and data analytics, this thesis contributes a novel taxonomy and a strategic roadmap for the seamless integration of IoT technologies in maritime environments. The findings underscore that the successful implementation of MIoT requires a holistic approach that balances technical innovation with rigorous standardization and cybersecurity. Ultimately, this work serves as a foundational resource for researchers and industry stakeholders navigating the complexities of the digital ocean, providing insights into emerging trends such as neuromorphic computing and quantum communications that will define the future of maritime operations.
